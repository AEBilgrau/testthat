* Environments:
  * should not be able to access variables created by other tests
  * should be able to turn off access to variables in global environment

* Other side effects:
  * set graphics device?
  * switch into temporary directory
  * capture output to screen
  * setup and tear down functions

* Option stop on error param for reporters?  Would then work more naturally with R CMD check

* Convert depends to imports

* New expectations:
