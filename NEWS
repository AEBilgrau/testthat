testthat 0.2

* equals expectation provides more information about failure
* new is_equivalent_to expectation that tests for equality ignoring attributes
* expect_that has extra info argument to allow you to pass in any extra information you'd like included in the message - this is very helpful if you're using a loop to run tests
* now looks for any files starting with test (not test- as before)
* also colourise in screen terminal
* library_if_available now works! (thanks to report and fix from Felix Andrews)
* specify larger width and join pieces back together whenever deparse used (thanks to report and fix from Felix Andrews)
